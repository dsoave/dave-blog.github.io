The Proprietary Black Box: Weakening Healthcare Tools in the Quest for Wealth

In my limited wealth ;) of experience, the best tools for predicting disease are simple, interpretable, and, dare I say, trustworthy. Take genomic data as an example. A small set of genes with some “known function” might help predict cancer or enable early diagnosis in the clinic. These models may not always dazzle in research papers or deliver groundbreaking sensitivity and specificity, but they’re something we can trust. We know how they work, we can explain them to patients, and we might even learn more about the diseases themselves.

But here’s the rub: you can’t patent a gene or the value in a simple, interpretable model. Sure, one might argue that a simple diagnostic test is patentable based on the proprietary method used to generate the data. That’s true—but even here, the model itself remains accessible. If the proprietary method is merely a fancy way of characterizing DNA methylation data, other technologies could achieve the same ends. The patent, in such cases, becomes less relevant. Without the lure of exclusivity, interested parties with a focus on wealth aren’t rushing to develop these kinds of tools. That’s where the black box comes in.

The Rise of the Black Box

The term “black box” originally comes from aviation, where it refers to a recorder that helps determine what went wrong after an incident. However, in machine learning and statistical modeling, a black box refers to a system or algorithm whose internal workings are opaque and not easily interpretable. It’s essentially a model where data goes in one end, and predictions come out the other, with little to no insight into the process.

In healthcare research, black-box algorithms have taken on a life of their own, especially in cancer care, where early detection is a holy grail. These algorithms don’t rely on a clear, defined set of genomic markers. Instead, they gorge on multiomics data—layers upon layers of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic information so vast it feels infinite.

With today’s computational power, researchers can spin these data into predictive models so complex that even their creators can’t explain them. What makes these black-box models proprietary is not just their complexity but the unique, often inscrutable, approach to generating the algorithm. This process involves specific decisions about data preparation, feature selection, model architecture, and training that, if not replicated precisely, will yield a different model entirely. This lack of reproducibility creates a dependency on the creator and makes it challenging to validate or adapt the model for broader use.

Often, these models obscure insights into the disease itself, offering only predictions without advancing our understanding. And that’s the problem: they’re proprietary, opaque, and often fail to deliver in practical, clinical settings.

Why are Black Boxes so Popular?

Two reasons.

First, they perform really well in tightly controlled research settings, which is likely a result of statistical overfitting. With too many predictors and not enough participants, it’s easy to create a model that performs perfectly in training but stumbles in the real world. You might say the model has already been tested on an external dataset (or two) in a rigorous research study. However, show me a researcher who says they did not revisit the training stage after observing the model performance in the "validation" data and I will show you a ... . This is a fatal violation of the model validation process.

 We should also note that simple, interpretable models can also be derived from large datasets. The key difference lies in the process: when creating and using interpretable models, researchers and practitioners are forced to scrutinize the model at every stage. They must ask whether the selected markers make sense, whether they have a biological connection to the disease, and whether the model’s predictions align with existing knowledge. This process of reflection not only enhances the model’s reliability but also often promotes further research to understand the underlying mechanisms. It takes a meticulous statistical approach to avoid these pitfalls.

Second, the profit motive. Unlike simple, interpretable models, black-box algorithms can be patented. This creates a significant financial incentive for companies to prioritize proprietary tools over transparent ones. By controlling the algorithm generation process—the unique way data is processed, modeled, and combined—companies can claim exclusivity, often resulting in a "lock-in" effect for users, where healthcare providers and researchers rely on the original developer for updates, validation, and adaptations.

While profit motives can drive innovation, they often do so at the expense of transparency and reproducibility. Black-box models are marketed as cutting-edge, their opacity paradoxically becoming a selling point. This allows companies to command higher prices, attract funding, and maintain competitive advantages. However, these models often fail to align with the needs of patients and clinicians, as their lack of interpretability can hinder trust and effective application.

It’s worth noting that not all black-box models are inherently problematic—some have demonstrated real clinical utility. But the dominance of profit-driven development in the field risks sidelining approaches that prioritize understanding and collaboration over exclusivity. A balance must be struck where financial incentives support, rather than undermine, the goals of patient-centered innovation.

A Call for Transparency

So, why do we keep seeing black boxes dominate top research journals and biotech startups? It’s not because they’re better; it’s because they’re lucrative. By locking insights behind proprietary algorithms, companies profit at the expense of interpretability and trust.

If we want healthcare tools that truly benefit patients, we need to prioritize transparency, interpretability, and clinical utility over profits. Tools that teach us about diseases, rather than just predicting outcomes, should be our ultimate goal.

Let’s demand more than predictions from our models. Let’s demand understanding—and in doing so, make healthcare innovation work for everyone.
